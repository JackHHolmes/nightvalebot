nightvalebot
============

An IRC bot that quotes proverbs from the Welcome to Night Vale podcast


So far, it connects irc channels successfully, but does not Quit or run its functions correctly.

To Do:
Complete the list of proverbs
Fix the Quit command
Fix both functions

Help:
If anyone knows how I can trigger the Quit command and have it say "Goodnight Nightvale, goodnight" before quiting, that would help a lot.
